<h1> General context of the project:</h1>
<p>CONSOMI TOUNSI as its name indicates it is a web site, Tunisian which represents
  the products 100% Tunisian on Tunisia and also elsewhere. The main activities of CONSOMI
  TOUNSI are the sale and after-sales service of Tunisian brand products</p>
<p>Before embarking on any project, it is essential to carefully study and analyse similar
  projects in order to take advantage of the benefits and avoid malevolence in the present project.
  Since we don't have a project of on-line sales which markets the products 100% Tunisian,
  for that I chose very famous sites in the on-line sale in Tunisia is JUMIA.tn and Artisansart.tn </p>
<p>In the Tunisian territory our problem is that we do not have a point of sale, whether online
  or real, to market 100% Tunisian products.
  As software engineers our solution is to create a web site that specialises in marketing all
  the products that are manufactured in Tunisia with the aim of improving our economy and
  encouraging customers to use Tunisian products.</p>
